Okay, let's make a mini-application using Tauri with any framework of your choice. Maybe let's go with Svelte just because I think it's a little bit simpler and it should result in a smaller .exe or package or whatever. To make a standalone application that makes it easy for people to drag files or folders that they want to lock for a specific amount of time. will then use this library below to essentially encrypt a key that will then be used to lock or unlock things. So essentially what it should do is it should zip up their folder or zip up their file and zip it with a password that we generate on demand and then use the user password and then we will save to JSON the file and the path to that key that we save It should essentially be saved as a file just in case they decide to delete you know this executable Basically the executable should kind of stand on its own and then it should be setting up files that can be used to decrypt the key And inside of the little application you can see all the things that you locked up and when they become unlocked and should have a cool UI. Basically, the point is to make a little thing that makes it easy for people to download a single file, this executable or whatever, on any platform that they're on, and then drag in a folder or file that they want to lock. They get to set the amount of time. They can either set it as, you know, hey, I want to lock this up for five minutes or I want to lock this up for a year or I want to lock this until December 27th, 19th, or, for 2027 or something like that So it flexible and gives them an easy way to kind of see all of the things that they locked up how much longer until they unlocked the date that they unlock and to add more things that they want to lock up And it shouldn have anything more than the exe that needs to be downloaded and all of the data that needs should just be put into a JSON file that lives alongside the executable And then the files that it locks up should be recoverable on their own as well So to do that it should have the key be a file that encrypted and then I guess people can go decrypt it using their own thing if they want I guess it's not really easy for them to decrypt. Point is, is it, we shouldn't, if, if the, they delete the time locker, it shouldn't make it so they can't recover their stuff. The key file should sit along the locked files, the locked zip, and at any point they can just download the time locker thing again and drag in a key file, and it will essentially give them all of the data that they need to re-import the, the key into the key. to the time locker thing Maybe we don even need the JSON data store Maybe instead the time locker just can sit alongside some keys and it look and see if there are any keys in its same directory or whatever And if there are then it pull the data from the keys You see in this place that I linking to that we using FrontMatter with YAML to essentially provide a bunch of metadata and so we can store most of the information that we need for the front UI kind of about what locked there And if there are any things that are missing like the reference to the zip file that been locked up and you know given the specific password then it can prompt the user hey where the file for this thing Just so that it can kind of make that connection and then update the key file to have the direct path the correct path for the user to that thing. Anyway, so very broad, kind of rough idea. I want you to take this, refine it, and make me this little application. Again, shouldn't be very complicated, but should be flexible, pretty, and the actual UI should be pretty minimal. Look at using shad CN for Svelte or whatever, or even just Tailwind. I guess you don't need to use shad CN, but make it look neat, clean. and mini. The window doesn't, shouldn't be very big. It should probably be at most like a, you know, 400 by 400 or 600 by 600 window. It's not resizable or something like that. That kind of just lists the little files in a drop zone to be able to lock things up. Cool. Go for it.
